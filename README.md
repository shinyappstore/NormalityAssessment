#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/NormalityAssessment](https://shinyappstore.com/a/NormalityAssessment)__

NormalityAssessment is a versatile tool designed for assessing normality in data through the creation of normal quantile-quantile (QQ) plots and histograms. This application offer users the ability to perform both the Rorschach and line-up procedures for normality assessment. NormalityAssessment allows the import of data sets from various file formats associated with popular software in different disciplines. The tool focuses on normal QQ plots and histograms, essential for checking the normality condition in parametric inferential and predictive methods. NormalityAssessment facilitates a two-stage process, starting with the Rorschach procedure to visualize natural variability in data, followed by the line-up stage where users input their data or choose from included datasets, identifying the normal QQ plot or histogram corresponding to their data from a grid of multiple plots.
